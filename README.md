# Arcade Game Clone

This is a clone of a classic arcade game (Frogger), as part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree (FEND).

### How to play
---
The player spawns at the bottom of the map, on grass. The objective is to reach the water at the top of the map.
Beware! Enemy bugs are roaming the road at various speeds. Using the arrow keys, move in all four directions to avoid the enemies, cross the road and reach freedom!
