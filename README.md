# Arcade Game Clone

This is a clone of a classic arcade game (Frogger), as part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree (FEND).
The player spawns at the bottom of the map, on grass. The objective is to reach the water at the top of the map.

Be careful, though! Enemy bugs are roaming the road at various speeds and will not hesitate to run you over (and perhaps eat you alive).

### How to play

Use the arrow keys to move in all four directions across the map and avoid the enemies.

### Installation

Download a copy of this repository. Then, simply load (open) the 'index.html' file in your browser and play!

Alternatively, you can also play the game on the Github page [here](https://eryhm.github.io/arcade-game/).
